C++ implementation of gradient temporal-difference learning algorithms (GTDL) for robotics and other applications.
The current implementation of GTDL algorithms have been successfully used in 3D soccer simulation formation learning
and predication. The code base contains only the basic algorithms, and they are tested with some started RL benchmark 
framework. Currently I am in the process adding more useful off-policy algorithms; incremental and least squire version; 
that is directly relevant for my research activities, that is, approximate human knowledge representation using approximate dynamic 
programming.
